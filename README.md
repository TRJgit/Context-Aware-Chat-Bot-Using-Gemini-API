Gemini Document Chat üìÑ‚ú®

A user-friendly, interactive chat application built with Streamlit that allows you to chat with your documents using Google's powerful Gemini models.

This application provides a clean interface to upload your documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT), ask questions about their content, and receive intelligent answers generated by the Gemini family of models.
üöÄ Features

    Google Gemini Integration: Seamlessly connect to Google's Generative AI models, including gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-1.5-pro, and gemini-pro.

    Document Chat: Upload your PDF, DOCX, or TXT files. The application extracts the text and uses it as context for your questions.

    Adjustable Model Parameters: Fine-tune the AI's responses by adjusting parameters like Temperature, Top-P, and Maximum Tokens directly from the UI.

    Persistent Chat History: Your conversation is saved for the duration of your session, allowing you to ask follow-up questions.

    Secure API Key Handling: Your Gemini API key is managed securely using Streamlit's password input field.

    Easy Chat Management: A dedicated button to clear the chat history and remove the uploaded document's context, allowing you to start fresh.

    Customizable UI: The theme of the application can be easily customized through the .streamlit/config.toml file to match your preferences.

üõ†Ô∏è How it Works

The application is built entirely in Python using the Streamlit framework. Here's a quick rundown of its operation:

    User Interface: The sidebar allows you to input your Gemini API key, select a Gemini model, and adjust its generation parameters. You can also upload a document.

    File Processing: When you upload a file (.pdf, .docx, .txt), the application uses libraries like PyPDF2 and python-docx to extract the text content. This text is stored in the session state.

    Context Injection: When you ask a question, the application automatically prepends the extracted document text as context to your prompt before sending it to the Gemini API.

    API Communication: The google-generativeai library handles the communication with the Gemini API.

    Streaming Response: The AI's response is streamed back and displayed in real-time in the chat interface for a dynamic, conversational experience.
